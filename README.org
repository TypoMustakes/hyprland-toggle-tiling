* hyprland-toggle-tiling

A simple program to toggle tiling and floating modes for windows in the Hyprland Wayland compositor.

[[./demo.gif]]

* Features

- Quickly switch between tiling and floating modes for all windows on the active workspace.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate with your Hyprland setup.
- Useful for workflows that require both tiling and floating window management.
- After switching, the program creates a hyprland config file to respect the new windowing mode.
  Let's say you switched to tiling mode. From that point on, new windows will open in tiling mode as well.
  Switch to floating mode again and newly opened windows will be in floating mode.

* Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
./htt <config-file-path>
#+END_SRC
- If the specified configuration file does not exist, it will be created.
- If the configuration contains existing rules, this should still work, but your existing configuration will probably get a bit messy, syntax-wise. I advise against it.

* Ingetration with Hyprland
1. Whatever configuration path you specify, include it in your Hyprland config, like so:
   ~\~/path/to/your/hyprland.conf~:
   #+BEGIN_SRC conf
   source = ~/path/to/specified/config/file.conf
   #+END_SRC

2. Bind the script to a key in your Hyprland config:
    #+BEGIN_SRC conf
    bind = $mod + t, exec, /path/to/htt <config-file-path>
    #+END_SRC

    Or not. Do whatever you want.
